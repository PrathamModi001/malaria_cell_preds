## Inspiration
Save humans by detecting and deploying Image Cells that contain Malaria or not!

To reduce the burden for microscopists in resource-constrained regions and improve diagnostic accuracy, researchers at the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications (LHNCBC), part of National Library of Medicine (NLM), have developed a mobile application, called “Malaria Screener”, which runs on a standard Android smartphone attached to a conventional light microscope. The smartphone's built-in camera acquired images of slides for each microscopic field of view. The images were manually annotated by an expert slide reader at the Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit in Bangkok, Thailand. The de-identified images and annotations are archived at NLM (IRB#12972)
